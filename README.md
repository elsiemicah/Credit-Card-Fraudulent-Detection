# Credit Card Fraud Detection Model

## Overview

This model detects fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. It analyzes various transaction features to identify patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior and distinguish them from legitimate transactions.

## Dataset

The model requires a dataset containing historical credit card transactions, ideally provided by financial institutions or obtained from publicly available sources like Kaggle. The dataset should include transaction amount, time, merchant category, and labels indicating fraudulent or legitimate transactions.
